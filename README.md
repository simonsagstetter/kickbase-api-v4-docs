# Kickbase API v4 Documentation

This is **preliminary, quick and dirty documentation** of the kickbase api **v4**. This work is unofficial and not related to kickbase in any way. All of this was done for scientific reasons only and you should not use it for anything else but for your personal learning!

There could be a lot more endpoints but with most I have found you should be able to retrieve the necessary data.

Tasks to complete:

- Response Body Description
- Request Bodies for most of the post or delete methods

Suggestions and contributions are welcome!
